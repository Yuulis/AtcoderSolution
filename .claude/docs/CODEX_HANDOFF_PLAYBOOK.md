# Codex Handoff Playbook

This document standardizes how Claude Code hands tasks to Codex so planning/implementation loops stay short and predictable.

## Goals

- Reduce retries caused by ambiguous Codex prompts.
- Keep Claude context small by returning concise summaries.
- Make Codex responses immediately actionable in Claude workflows.

## 1) Delegation Decision Matrix

Use Codex when **at least one** is true:

- Architecture or module boundary decisions are involved.
- The implementation requires multiple dependent steps.
- The error root cause is unknown.
- Trade-off comparison is required.
- The change affects 2+ files with behavioral impact.

Skip Codex when all are true:

- Single-file, obvious edit.
- <10 LOC change.
- No design decision or risk.

## 2) Prompt Contract (Required Fields)

Every Codex prompt should include:

1. **Objective**: one-sentence outcome.
2. **Constraints**: language, style, forbidden approaches.
3. **Relevant files**: explicit paths.
4. **Acceptance checks**: commands to run.
5. **Output format**: concise markdown sections.

## 3) Recommended Prompt Templates

### A. Planning / Design (read-only)

```bash
codex exec --model gpt-5.4 --sandbox read-only --full-auto "
Objective: Create an implementation plan for {feature}.
Constraints:
- Keep existing architecture unless explicitly justified.
- Prefer minimal diff.
Relevant files:
- {file1}
- {file2}
Acceptance checks:
- {test or lint commands}
Output format:
## Analysis
## Recommendation
## Implementation Plan
## Risks
## Next Steps
"
```

### B. Complex Implementation (workspace-write)

```bash
codex exec --model gpt-5.4 --sandbox workspace-write --full-auto "
Objective: Implement {feature/fix}.
Constraints:
- Follow project lint/type/test rules.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
Relevant files:
- {file1}
- {file2}
Acceptance checks:
- {test or lint commands}
Output format:
## Changes Made
## Validation
## Remaining Risks
"
```

## 4) Claude-side Compression Rules

When Codex finishes, Claude should keep only:

- Top recommendation.
- 3-5 implementation steps.
- Risks requiring user decision.

Store long analysis in `.claude/docs/research/` and reference the path in user-facing updates.

## 5) Failure Recovery

If Codex output is not actionable:

1. Re-run with explicit file list and acceptance checks.
2. Split into two calls: `read-only` plan → `workspace-write` implementation.
3. Ask Codex to compare exactly two options and choose one.

## 6) Codex Plugin Workflows (codex-plugin-cc)

When the `openai/codex-plugin-cc` plugin is installed, use these structured workflows:

### A. Review Before Shipping

```bash
# Quick review of current changes
/codex:review

# Review branch diff against main
/codex:review --base main

# Background review (non-blocking)
/codex:review --background
/codex:status          # Check progress
/codex:result          # Get results
```

### B. Adversarial Review (Challenge Design)

```bash
# Challenge implementation and design decisions
/codex:adversarial-review

# Focus on specific risk areas
/codex:adversarial-review --background look for race conditions and question the chosen approach
```

### C. Task Delegation (Rescue)

```bash
# Investigate a bug
/codex:rescue investigate why the tests started failing

# Fix with minimal patch
/codex:rescue fix the failing test with the smallest safe patch

# Continue previous task
/codex:rescue --resume apply the top fix from the last run

# Use specific model/effort
/codex:rescue --model gpt-5.4-mini --effort medium investigate the flaky test
```

### D. Plugin vs Direct CLI Decision

Use **Plugin** when:
- You need structured review (code review, adversarial review)
- You want background execution with job tracking
- You want to delegate and monitor a task

Use **Direct CLI** (`codex exec`) when:
- You need custom prompt format with specific output structure
- You need sandbox mode control (read-only vs workspace-write)
- You are calling from a subagent pattern
